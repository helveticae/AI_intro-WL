    "Cleaning or cleansing is a type of data validation involving removing typographical errors or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. For example, several houses might have the same location with different spelling or letter casing. In the above example, the attributes \"sellingPrice\" and \"rooms\" are formatted in a way which is easy to read for a human, but inconviniet for a machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a string-searching algorithm such as [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), we easily reformat sellingPrice by removing blank spaces, leaving us with an integer. A similar technique applies to rooms and other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking up a group or a string into separate components is called parsing. By parsing the location values, perhaps through slicing, the issues can be corrected using different methods. In ML this is an example of pre-processing.\n",

    "### How does linear regression work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical technique used to predict values of a continuous dependent variable, given a set of predictor variables (key values). The method is used to find the equation of a line that best fits a given set of data points. The equation can be used to make predictions about the dependent variable, given new values of the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll split our data set into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train our model and the test set will be used to evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method might not be the best model for this scenario - a linear regression model would not be able to accurately capture the more complex relationship between housing features and some data, such as location, needs to be quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can the model be put into production?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should be carefully tested and evaluated before deployment. Once QA had been completed, we could use [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).\n",
